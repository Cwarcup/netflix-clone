In this installment, we continue our exploration of every hotel on the Vegas strip, taking on the 14 hotels on the East side of the Strip. Still big fans, and still providing our thoughts on the room, vibes, and activities at each hotel - again, just in case you need it. We took on everything the strip had to throw at us - heat, celebrity restaurant pasta dishes, serenading gondoliers - until we finally made it to the end. We came, we saw, we stayed - here are the final 14! What do you guys think?

          "description": "Check out part 1 here! https://youtu.be/0e8woEkKmG8\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! In this installment, we continue our exploration of every hotel on the Vegas strip, taking on the 14 hotels on the East side of the Strip. Still big fans, and still providing our thoughts on the room, vibes, and activities at each hotel - again, just in case you need it. We took on everything the strip had to throw at us - heat, celebrity restaurant pasta dishes, serenading gondoliers - until we finally made it to the end. We came, we saw, we stayed - here are the final 14! What do you guys think? Which hotel would you choose?\n\nAlso, when we say \"Operated Independently\" - we mostly mean, not operated by MGM or Caesars!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\u200b\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nCarrie Roper \nMelissa Douglas\nClare Gelber\nJack Scott\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nMike Pearson III\nGerman Torres\nSteven Yonce\nCorey Glynn\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nRESEARCH by\nRachel Faulkner White \nSabrina Ford\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:20 The Sahara\n4:56 The Wynn / Encore\n11:42 The Venetian / Palazzo\n17:23 Harrah’s\n20:44 The LINQ\n26:17 Flamingo\n29:25 The Cromwell\n32:16 Bally’s (now Horseshoe)\n35:50 Paris\n40:07 Planet Hollywood\n43:25 The MGM Grand\n47:19 The Tropicana\n50:50 Outro & Our Recommendations \n\n#vegas #hotel #travel"
